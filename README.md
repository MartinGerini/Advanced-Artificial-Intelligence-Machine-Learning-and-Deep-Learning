In the following codes, the projects for the course Advanced Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are presented, split in 4 different assignments:

- Multi-Layer Perceptron, Generalized Matrix Factorization and Neural Matrix Factorization
- Explainable AI techinques
- Graph Representation Learning
- Transformer and Self-Attention 

The objective is building a recommender system making use of these different approaches, refined to work with the dataset ml-100k.
